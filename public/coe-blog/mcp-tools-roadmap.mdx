# MCP Tools Roadmap - Q1 2024

As we continue to expand our AI capabilities, we're focusing heavily on Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to enhance our development workflow and model interactions.

## üéØ Strategic Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Standardize MCP Integration**: Create consistent patterns for all MCP tools
- **Developer Experience**: Improve tooling and documentation
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce latency and improve reliability
- **Security Enhancement**: Implement robust security measures

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Tools

### 1. Code Analysis MCP
**Timeline**: Week 2-4
**Priority**: High

- **Function**: Analyze code quality and suggest improvements
- **Integration**: VS Code extension, CLI tool
- **Features**:
  - Security vulnerability detection
  - Performance optimization suggestions
  - Code style enforcement
  - Documentation generation

### 2. Database Query MCP
**Timeline**: Week 3-5
**Priority**: High

- **Function**: Natural language to SQL conversion
- **Integration**: Database management tools
- **Features**:
  - Query optimization
  - Schema analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Query explanation

### 3. API Testing MCP
**Timeline**: Week 4-6
**Priority**: Medium

- **Function**: Automated API testing and validation
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipelines
