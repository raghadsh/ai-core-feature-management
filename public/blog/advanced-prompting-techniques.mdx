# Advanced Prompting Techniques for Better AI Results

Prompt engineering is both an art and a science. Here are some advanced techniques to improve your AI interactions.

## The Chain of Thought Method

Instead of asking direct questions, guide the AI through its reasoning:

```
❌ Bad: "What's the capital of France?"

✅ Good: "Let's think step by step. I need to find the capital of France. 
France is a country in Europe. The capital city is typically the seat of 
government and largest city. What is the capital of France?"
```

## Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to establish patterns:

```
Classify the sentiment of these movie reviews:

Review: "This movie was absolutely amazing!"
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "I hated every minute of it."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It was okay, nothing special."
Sentiment: Neutral

Review: "The acting was terrible but the plot was good."
Sentiment: Mixed
```

## Role-Based Prompting

Assign specific roles to get better context:

```
You are an expert data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning. 
Explain the concept of overfitting in a way that a business executive would understand.
```

## Constraint-Based Prompts

Set clear boundaries and requirements:

```
Write a product description for a new smartphone that:
- Is exactly 100 words
- Includes 3 key features
- Uses a professional tone
- Avoids technical jargon
- Ends with a call-to-action
```

## Interactive Elements

Here's a simple interactive component you can use in your prompts:

```jsx
<InteractiveExample>
  <PromptInput placeholder="Try your own prompt here..." />
  <GenerateButton>Generate Response</GenerateButton>
</InteractiveExample>
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vague Instructions**: Be specific about what you want
2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Maintain structure across examples
3. **Too Many Constraints**: Balance specificity with flexibility
4. **Ignoring Context**: Consider the AI's training data and capabilities
